•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
The client I was assisting was a financial service company named Artemis Financial. Addressing vulnerabilities in their system was my requirement. Also, add coding and analyzing their system to help prevent cyber security theft.

•	What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I analyzed my client’s software security vulnerabilities. I reinforced and effectively patched their security system. A company’s security software is important, and coding securely is more important due to its help against potential breaches and unauthorized access to a company’s sensitive data.

•	Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment for me was creating a localhost website connection on OS Mac computer format. I will try it again on Windows format to complete the task that I seem to have had trouble with, for my own fulfillment.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Introducing a firewall, multifactor authentication, and encrypted sensitive data was how I increased layers of security for Artemis Financial. I would first use a vulnerability scan tool. Then, I would run a penetration test to access the vulnerability. Last, analyze the vulnerabilities and decide the best mitigation techniques to use.

•	How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I scanned for vulnerabilities and reviewed the code.  Then, I refactored the code and used a code analysis tool to check for new vulnerabilities. I conducted rigorous tests after to make sure. 

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Secure coding, penetration testing, and vulnerability scan tools are the most helpful code practices. In the future, these tools and practices will still be beneficial for company tasks and security assignments. 

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
In this assignment, I don’t believe it will show an employer my best work, but I do believe with more experience, and will have a more complex portfolio. I plan to attach both projects, although my thoughts about them. It will shows employers, where I began and how long I’ve come.
